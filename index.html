            <b>Welcome!</b><br>
            <br>
            Welcome to the first puzzle of this escape room! To proceed to the other puzzles you must first complete
            mine!<br>
            <br>
            At the start of the game, you will be given a 6 digit 'guide number'.<br>
            <br>
            This number will be your tool to solve the puzzle.<br>
            <br>
            The puzzle consists of three sets of random letter sequences.<br>
            <br>
            It is your job to work out which numbers from the 'guide number', when added to each of your scrambled
            letters, move forward through the alphabetic sequence to make up a 6 letter number in word format.<br>
            <br>
            For example FOURTY<br>
            <br>
            The aim of the puzzle is to find three of these 6 letter numbers.<br>
            <br>
            HINT: A+3=D<br>
            <br>
            Use this technique to try adding different numbers from the 'guide number' to each of the letters in the
            scrambled sequences.<br>
            <br>
            HINT: The alphabet wheel can be used to count.<br>
            <br>
            Once you have entered your 6 letter number in the answer box, press enter. The box will go green if you are
            correct, red if you are not! You have <u>8</u> minutes to complete this!<br>
            <br>
            GOOD LUCK!
